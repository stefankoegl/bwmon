                 bwmon: Application-level bandwidth monitoring
                 ---------------------------------------------

 bwmon is an open bandwidth monitoring solution for monitoring per-application
 bandwidth usage. This can be utilized to better manage and monitor multiple
 applications running on a single cloud host or a single application running
 on multiple cloud hosts.

 -- Features --

   * Uses ip_conntrack to track connections
   * Alternative, cross-platform "pipe" traffic monitor
   * Easily customizable: Written in Python
   * Combination of conntrack+pipe monitors possible
   * Open Framework: Create new monitoring methods
   * Support for SLA parameter input (bandwidth allocation)
   * Support for SLA violation notification to external services
   * Fully documented source code and user manual

 -- News --

   November 2012 (Version 1.1):
   In recent kernels, there's no "ip_conntrack" kernel module. As
   a replacement, bwmon now supports the "conntrack" command-line
   utility from the "conntrack-utils" package.

   Make sure to run this command to enable accounting for conntrack
   (otherwise you might get a "KeyError: 'bytes'" traceback):

       sysctl -w net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=1

   Sometimes you have to wait a bit after setting this option to
   make sure old connections are removed from conntrack's output.
